## Del 1
My first VHDL/FPGA project:
In this part I used a DE1-SoC board to test a program made in Quartus.
This project was simply to connect 10 LEDs to 10 switches. 
The LEDs should turn on/off when the corresponding switch is turned on/off.

## Del 2
A 7-segment display:
This program displays numbers from 0 to 9 on a 7-segment display using 4 switches.
The input, from the switches, is binary code so 0000 = 0, 0001 = 1. 0010 = 2 and so on.
A DE1-SoC board was used in this part

## Del 3
Increment a 7-segment display by using a 4-bit counter and a push button:
This program is also simulated using a testbench.
